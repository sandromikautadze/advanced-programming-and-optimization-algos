# Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithms

The following repository containts all the graded assigments of the course in _Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithms_ taken in the 2nd semester of my 2nd year at university. The main outline of the course was that of covering fundamental techniques for solving optimization problems, namely linear programming as well as discrete and convex optimization.

## Topics

These are the topics covered in each assignment: 

- Assignment 1
    - LP sklutions and LP modelling 
    - Zero-sum games

- Assignment 2
    - Image recognition as min-cost flow problem
    
- Assignment 3
    - TBA
    
- Assignment 4
    - TBA
