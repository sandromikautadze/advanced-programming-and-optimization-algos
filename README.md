# Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithms

This repository contains the graded assignments for the course in Advanced Programming and Optimization Algorithms, which I took during the second semester of my second year at university. The course covered theory and fundamental techniques for solving optimization problems, including linear programming, discrete optimization, and convex optimization.

## Description

The assignments are designed to help students apply the optimization techniques learned in the course and develop some techniques independently. The main topics of each assignment are the following:

- Assignment 1
    - Modelling of linear programs
    - Zero-sum games

- Assignment 2
    - Image recognition as min-cost flow problem
    
- Assignment 3
    - TBA
    
- Assignment 4
    - TBA
